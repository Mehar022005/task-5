Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests
Objective To explore tree-based models using the Heart Disease Dataset for classification.

Dataset
Used heart.csv, which contains patient data with a target column indicating heart disease.

Tools Used
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Pandas

Steps Performed
Trained a Decision Tree and visualized it.
Controlled overfitting using 'max_depth=4'.
Trained a Random Forest and compared accuracy.
Interpreted top 5 feature importances.
Performed 5-fold cross-validation.


Results
Decision Tree Accuracy: ~0.80
Random Forest Accuracy: ~0.85-0.90
Cross-validation Accuracy: ~0.86


Key Features
'ca', 'thal', 'oldpeak', 'cp', 'thalach' were among the top features.
